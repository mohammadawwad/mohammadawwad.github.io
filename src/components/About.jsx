                Responsible for Creating interactive and visually appealing 
                website on both Computers and Phones. Working at Stylish Tile 
                I learned a lot especially becaus eI worked with a team of designers.
                Working there also taught me many all the fundamentals of web 
                programming since I created the site without any frameworks. 
                It was challenging but gained a lot of experience with HTML, CSS,
                and Javascript since I made everything from scratch.

                Held an online workshop where I taught a number
                of students how to program virtual robots. The group of kids 
                I taught where beginners and had little experience, so we began with 
                basics of block coding. Fundamentals are important so we started with 
                variable deceleration, to if/else statements, they where having so much fun
                so, we continued to teach them all sorts of loops. By the near end of the workshop
                the students all had functional robots with sensors and autonomous routines.
