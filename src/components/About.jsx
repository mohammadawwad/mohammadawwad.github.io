                Responsible for Creating interactive and visually appealing 
                website compatible with Computers and Phones. I learned a lot while working 
                at Stylish Tile especially because I worked with a team of designers.
                Working there also taught me many skills and all the fundamentals of web 
                development since I created the website without any frameworks. 
                It was challenging but I gained a lot of experience with HTML, CSS,
                and Javascript since everything was made from scratch.

                FRC stands for First Robotics Competition which is an organization

                the world. As the Software Engineer Team Lead of FRC team 6390 Hephaestus
                I am responsible for programming the robotâ€™s functionality, movement and
                making it be as easy as possible to be teleoperated (Remote Controlled). I also have developed complex
                auto routines using PID (Potential Integral Derivative) for precision, not only do I program in Java I also teach
                it so that the upcoming generations of the Robotics Team have strong programmers,
                capable of delivering upon the teams standard.

                Held an online workshop where I taught a number
                of students how to program virtual robots. The group of kids 
                I taught where beginners and had little experience to no experience programming, so we began with 
                the basics of block coding. Fundamentals are important so we started with 
                variable deceleration, then moved to if/else statements, they where having so much fun,
                so we continued to teach them all sorts of loops and how to use sensors. By the near end of the workshop
                the students all had functional robots with sensors and autonomous routines.
