The game is simple and has two controls\r\n                Right and Left. The game consists of a cubed played that is constantly moving forward and \r\n                its speed increases over time. The goal of the game was to make it to the finish line without \r\n                hitting any of the obstacles in your way.

But I have found an example of the game since the idea of the game\r\n                got really popular.
